# Code Break Lockdown: An Educational CS Game

Code Break Lockdown is a beginner-friendly, educational computer science game that is designed to enhance learning and engagement for students at CSU. Developed using the open-source game engine Godot, the game employs an escape room format where players solve computer science-themed puzzles to progress and escape. The game features a scene manager with a passcode-based system for level progression and global randomization to encourage concept learning over memorization. The game’s puzzles focus on using CIS concepts such as variables, if-else statements, bitwise operations, binary conversion, and loops to beat levels. Emphasizing intuitive gameplay, visual appeal, and educational effectiveness, Code Break Lockdown aims to serve as an interactive learning resource to complement traditional CIS courses.
